# 🍎 Smart Sorting: Rotten vs Fresh Fruit & Vegetable Classification Using Transfer Learning

Smart Sorting is a lightweight deep learning web application that classifies fruits and vegetables as **fresh** or **rotten** across 16 categories. It uses **transfer learning** with **MobileNetV2** and a modern **Flask** backend to deliver fast and accurate predictions in real time.

---

## 🧠 About the Project

This system helps automate the classification of produce images to support smarter food packaging, reduce post-harvest waste, and enhance quality control in agriculture and retail.

It can identify:

* 🟢 **Fresh Produce** (Apple, Banana, Tomato, etc.)
* 🔴 **Spoiled Produce** (Rotten Apple, Rotten Tomato, etc.)

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Upload** an image of a fruit or vegetable.
2. The app uses **deep learning** to analyze the image.
3. A **prediction** (fresh/rotten + class name) is returned, along with a confidence score and image preview.

---

## ✅ Key Features

* 🔍 **Classifies 16 produce types** (8 fresh + 8 rotten)
* ⚙️ **Transfer learning** with MobileNetV2 for optimized speed and accuracy
* 🫼 Built-in **OpenCV image preprocessing**
* 💻 **Flask web interface** with real-time feedback
* 🎨 Clean, modern **HTML/CSS-based frontend**
* 📷 Inline **image preview** for visual confirmation
